# Hack Writeups

A collection of my personal writeups documenting my journey, methodologies, and learnings from various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, penetration testing labs, and real-world security vulnerabilities.

## 📖 About

This repository serves as my public notebook for security research and ethical hacking. Each writeup details the steps taken to solve a challenge, the tools used, the vulnerabilities exploited, and the key concepts learned along the way.

The goal is to:
- **Solidify my own understanding** by documenting the process.
- **Share knowledge** with the cybersecurity community.
- **Create a reference** for myself and others tackling similar problems.

## 🛠️ Common Tools & Methodologies

Throughout these writeups, you will frequently encounter the use of standard penetration testing tools and methodologies, such as:

- **Reconnaissance:** `nmap`, `gobuster`, `subfinder`, `theHarvester`
- **Enumeration:** `enum4linux`, `smbclient`, `ffuf`, `nikto`
- **Exploitation:** `Metasploit`, `sqlmap`, custom Python scripts, `Burp Suite`
- **Post-Exploitation:** `linpeas`, `winpeas`, `mimikatz`, privilege escalation scripts
- **Forensics/Crypto:** `Wireshark`, `binwalk`, `steghide`, `John the Ripper`

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse by Platform:** Navigate to the folder of the platform you're interested in (e.g., `HackTheBox`).
2. **Find a Specific Machine/Room:** Look for a markdown file named after the machine or room.
3. **Learn and Follow Along:** Each writeup is intended to be a step-by-step guide. Feel free to follow along if you are stuck on a similar challenge.
